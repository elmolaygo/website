# elmolaygo.netlify.app

Source-code of my website on netlify.

I've been learning more coding these past few months so I decided to make a new version of the site, I out it on the pre-release branch for now. The current version of the site is 2 year old code from my past self. Since I have improved a lot I'll make more features to my site. o/
